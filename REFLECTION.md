## Assignment 3A Reflection

In my assignment, I practiced cloning a repo in GitHub, staging changes, writing commit messages, and pushing to GitHub. I also learned how to organize code changes into meaningful commits instead of doing everything at once.

On the JS side, I reviewed function syntax, return values, optional parameters, and how a closure works. Writing comments for each function helped me think about what the code actually does, rather than just typing it out. Overall this assignment made me more comfortable with using Git and writing JavaScript functions.

Most of the functions followed a simple input->output pattern. I was not really surprised by any of the results.

No logic really challenged my thinking as these functions were pretty basic and straightforward.

Functions like these could be used in areas like data processing and calculations. For example, in industries like oil and gas, similar functions might be used for things such as unit conversions (bbl to m³, psi to Pa, etc.).
