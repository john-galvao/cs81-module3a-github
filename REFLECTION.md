## Assignment 3A Reflection

I learned how to add folders, commit changes, and push the changes to GitHub. This process in itself was confusing because you have to add the folder each time and write an individual commit message. 

I think developers use Git in order to track changes in their projects, and share these changes with other developers. It allows collaboration, in my opinion. 

This might help with larger projects in the future because not only will it allow developers to collaborate from across the United States and even the world, but it can keep everything organized and, if there are multiple people working on a single project, Git can help keep track of all contributers and provide a degree of organization to a larger project.
